# Personal Finance Tracker
Personal Finance Tracker is a simple and intuitive web application built with React that helps users take control of their finances. The app allows users to add income and expense entries, view a running total of their finances, and set a personal savings goal. As users track their earnings and spending, the app calculates their net balance and visually shows progress toward their savings goal with a dynamic progress bar.

This project focuses on clean UI/UX design, interactive features, and real-time state management using React’s useState hook. It’s structured with reusable, modular components and styled using vanilla CSS for responsiveness across devices.
